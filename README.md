**ABSTRACT**


The ubiquity of Android devices and the increasing reliance on mobile applications have made them lucrative targets for malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for various malicious purposes. Traditional signature-based detection methods are often insufficient in identifying emerging and polymorphic malware variants, necessitating more sophisticated approaches. Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as promising tools for malware detection due to their ability to discern patterns and anomalies in large datasets.

This study proposes a comprehensive framework for analyzing and detecting malware in Android applications using machine learning algorithms. The framework involves several stages, including feature extraction, dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation. Feature extraction involves extracting relevant features from the application's code and metadata, capturing its behavior, permissions, and structural characteristics.

A diverse dataset comprising both benign and malicious Android applications is collected and preprocessed for model training. Various machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and deep learning architectures are explored for their effectiveness in classifying applications as benign or malicious.

The proposed framework is evaluated using real-world Android malware samples and benign applications. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the effectiveness of the trained models in accurately classifying malware. Additionally, the framework's robustness against adversarial attacks and its scalability to large datasets are evaluated.

The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively detect and classify Android malware with high accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, the framework exhibits resilience against evasion techniques employed by sophisticated malware variants. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of malware detection techniques in the Android ecosystem, enhancing the security posture of mobile devices and protecting users against evolving cyber threats.
